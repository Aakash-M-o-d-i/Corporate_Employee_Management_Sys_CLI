- **`Employee`** (Abstract Class):
    - Base class for all employees.
    - Contains common attributes like `employeeID`, `name`, `age`, and `salary`.
    - Abstract methods: `calculateBonus()` and `displayDetails()`.
- **`FullTimeEmployee`**:
    - Inherits from `Employee`.
    - Includes additional attributes like `benefitsPacket` and calculates a 20% bonus.
- **`PartTimeEmployee`**:
    - Inherits from `Employee`.
    - Includes additional attributes like `hourlyRate` and `hoursWorked` and calculates a 10% bonus.

### 2. **Department Class**
- Manages a list of employees.
- Allows adding and removing employees.
- Generates a department report with employee details.

### 3. **Project Class**
- Associates projects with departments.
- Displays project details, including the assigned department.

### 4. **Corporate Class**
- Manages departments and projects.
- Generates a corporate report summarizing all departments and projects.
